- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jorgiz
- 👀 I’m interested in learn about game development and become a good game maker.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games on the free and open source Godot Engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I often use like Gimp and Godot.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me at my twitter account. Its a brazzilian account, therefore I speak portuguese in there, but if you talk to me in english, I will respond in english as well. The only downside is that you probably won't be able to understand my awesome tweets. hehe.
