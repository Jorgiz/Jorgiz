- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jorgiz
- 👀 I’m interested in learn about game development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games using the free and open source Godot Engine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I often use like Gimp, Godot and Shotcut. But I don't have the necessary knowledge to do it yet. Also, I'm aiming to become a great game developer, so one day I can work with it.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me at my twitter account. Its a brazilian account, therefore I speak brazilian-portuguese in there, but if you talk to me in english, I will respond in english as well. The only downside is that you probably won't be able to understand my awesome tweets. hehe.
